                <li>
                     Data :Any value or set of value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Structure : Arrangement of and relation between these data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data may be organize in different ways and the logical or mathematical model of a particular organisation of data is called a data structure. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    In simple terms, a <q class="q">data structure is a particular way of organizing data within a computer so that it can be used effectively.</q>

                <h2>Which Data Structure Should you use ?</h2>
                <h3>To answer this we have 2 parameters :</h3>
                <li>
                    The model must be rich enough in structure to <q class="q">mirror the actual relationship of the data</q> in the real world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It should be simple enough that one can <q class="q">effectively process the data</q> whenever necessary.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
               <h2>What is an algorithm</h2>
               <li>
                Any well-defined computational procedure that takes in input in that form of some value or set of value and produces an output in the form of some value, or set of values is known as an algorithm. 
               </li>
               <li>
                Formerly defining, <q class="q">an algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transforms the input into the output.</q>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>Correctness and Characteristics of algorithm</h2>
                <li>
                    An algorithm is said to be <q class="q">correct if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.</q> We say that a correct algorithm solves the given computational problem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An incorrect algorithm might not halt all on some input instances, or it might halt with an incorrect answer.
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <h3>Characteristics of an algorithmic problem :</h3>

                        They have a <q class="q">number of solution.</q> Finding the best is a challenge though.

                        Knowledge of a number of methods makes it easier for you to choose the best.

                        It is always good to understand the actual woking of any component of the software.

                <li>
                    Computers may be fast,but they are not infinitely fast.And memory may be inexpenseive,but itis not free.

                <li>
                    Computing time and space in memory is a a bounded resource.You should use these resources wisely,and algorithms that are effiecient in terms of time or space will help you do so.

                <li>
                    Code is a term used to describe text that is written using the protocol(syntax) of a particular language by a computer programmer.

                <li>
                    In simple words, code can be described as a set of rules that we as progrmmers give to the computer for it to perform a certain task.

                            Let us know line by line.
                            <pre>
                                // The Double slash lines are used to comment single line.
                                For multiple comment lines we use <!---->
                                The program starts with the line
                                #include &lt;iostream&gt
                                // were <q>#</q> is pound sign <q>inculde</q> is a directive which procressed by preprocess directives it tells to inculde the file.In this case the file is <q>iostream</q>.
                                This statement tells the complier to inculde iostream file.Becase iostream file containes declarations of all input and output functions.
                                The next statement is 
                                using namespace std;
                                In this using &rarr; use
                                namespace &rarr; spaces are created to aviod conflicts(like using same variables,functions,etc)
                                std &rarr; standard
                                The overall meaning is use the standard namespace if don't use this we can use as std::cout,std::cin,std::endl,etc;
                                The nextline is 
                                int main(){
                                }
                                where int &rarr; retrun type
                                main() &rarr; main function
                                The over meaning is the main function return integer data.
                                fuction is group of instructions that will perform a particular task.
                                then last line is 
                                cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
                                return 0;
                                This tells the complier to print/display Hello World! statement as output, where <q>;</q> tells the end of the statement,endl is another fuction which means the end of line.
                                cout &rarr; output function
                                <q><<</q> &rarr; definee what is to be printed
                                retrun 0 &rarr; it a statement use to return a value from a function.It is usally last line before the function ends.
                            </pre> 
                            we get output as

                            In the above example program we followed a particular order like

                        Input streams : This is a type of stream where the bytes flow from a device such as a keyboard to main memory.
                        Output Stream : This is a type of stream where the bytes flow in the opposite direction, that is, from main memory then to the device such as display screen.

                        A variable is a term used for the name give to any value in c++.It is the basic unit of storage in a program and its value can be changed as per the execution of the program.<q class="q">All variables in C++ muat be declared before used.</q>

                                Variable declaration :  We can decalre a variable as data_type name_data_type,we decalre single or multiple data types at a time.
